## Getting Started

First, link the project and pull environment variables:

```bash
vercel link
vercel env pull
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can start editing the agent by modifying `agent/agent.ts`. Its behavior is defined in `agent/instructions.md`, and tools live in `agent/tools/`. The agent auto-updates as you edit the files.

This project uses the Eve framework's bundled guides — see `node_modules/eve/dist/docs/public/` after installing dependencies.
